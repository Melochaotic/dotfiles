# git hook to run a command after `git pull` if a specified file was changed
# monrepo idea from https://dev.to/zirkelc/automatically-install-npm-dependencies-on-git-pull-bg0

# ### This works in Monorepos w/o workspaces setup
# check_run() {
#   PACKAGES=($(git diff --name-only HEAD@{1} HEAD | grep -E "$1" ))

#   if [[ ${PACKAGES[@]} ]]; then
#     for package in $PACKAGES; do
#       echo '---'
#       echo "ðŸ“¦ $package changed. Running '$2' to update your dependencies..."
#       (cd $(dirname $package) && eval "$2")
#     done
#   fi
# }

### This runs cmd from project root
